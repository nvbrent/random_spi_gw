/*
 * Notes to developers:
 *
 * What is this, why would I use it?
 *
 *     doca-unique_ptr adds a partial specialization of std::unique_ptr that uses class template to delegate to an
 *     overloaded deleter function (doca_deleter). This makes it easy to manage the lifetime of a C object in a RAII
 *     fashion so that is will be safely deleted in any C++ context, this frees you from the burden of writing duplicate
 *     free calls, the doca::unique_ptr will assure that the object cannot be leaked by going out of scope even in the
 *     case of an exception being thrown, or a class failing to fully construct.
 *
 *     See:
 *         https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/exceptions#selfcleaning-members
 *
 * How do I teach doca::unique_ptr to support a new type?
 *
 *     Add an overload of doca_deleter to teach unique_ptr how to destroy your type. The overload does not need to exist
 *     in this file, just just need to make sure the compiler sees the overload before you try to use a
 *     doca::unique_ptr. The deleter must exist in the same namespace as the type to be destroyed as per ADL rules, so
 *     for C types this will always be the global namespace.
 *
 *     For example you could do something like this in any other file:
 *
 *     void doca_deleter(my_thing *thing) {
 *         destroy_my_thing(thing);
 *     }
 *
 *     See:
 *         https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/overload_resolution
 *         https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl
